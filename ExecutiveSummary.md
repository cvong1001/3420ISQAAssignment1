This repository is designed to scan for licenses and vulnerabilities in OSS software packages that a developer inputs into the system. The system groups these packages into proects (groups) for the manager to view. The manager is able to add or update policies within these projects. This repository is important because it allows a business to create software projects that are not comprimising in licenses and vulnerabilities. The developer and manager are able to communicate and create new software packages for the business. If the business had software projects that had comprimising licenses and vulnerabilities, the business would have legal issues to settle.  

This repository creates software projects with policies that have been check for licenses and vulnerabilites. It starts with the developer inputing software packages to get scanned for licenses and vulnerabiltiies. The results is first sent to sent a database that stores this information and then to a query database to be turned into software projects that the manager and developer can view. After the software projects have been viewed, the projects are scanned for policies that the manager and developer can view. The policies are stored into another database where the manager uses a process to add or update policies on any projects in this system. If anything is updated by the manager, the developer will be able to receive this information.
